# PROCEDURAL WALKING ANIMATION
This project aims to create a spider like creature which walks using procedural animations. Procedural animation are animations generated in real time (i.e instead of doing animations by hand, the movements are generated by a script). This is particularly useful when it comes to creating walking animations that adapt according to the features of a terrain.
